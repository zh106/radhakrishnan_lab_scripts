# radhakrishnan_lab_scripts

Hello, this is a repository for keeping up-to-date scripts for projects in the Radhakrishnan lab. In addition to keeping up-to-date scripts, git will also record version history so that changes to scripts can be seen when the repository is updated. Git-hub can also be used for more advanced utilities if that's desirable in the future. Essentially, this is a good way to get everyone's updated scripts in an easy-to-find place with proper documentation on how to use it.


## How does git work at a basic level?

For this lab, git and GitHub will primarily be used as an introduction to git and version control.    

For starters, git is a version control system that can be used solely from the command line. It's primarily used when developing large projects so multiple developers can work on the same project without messing each other’s code up. It also adds a lot of functionality when merging two people’s edits so they don't clash.

GitHub, on the other hand, is a cloud-based platform that acts almost like a centralized location that can make collaboration or showcasing your work easier. GitHub is built on git and revolves around the git functionality.

In our lab, we use git as a version control system for how our scripts change over time in addition to using it for easier collaboration. Having all our important scripts in one place makes it easier to understand our workflow. We use GitHub to have a web-based remote version of our local repositories on our computing resources (i.e. sodium, iron, HPC).


## How should I use this repository?

Using this repository is pretty simple if you don't know git. Once you write a script for a project in the lab, copy over the most updated
version into an appropriately named folder in this repository like any old directory. If you make changes to that script, copy over the newe
r version and rewrite the old version (so keep the name the same). GitHub will show the history of how the file changed on the website of this repository. It doesn't do this automatically so people who know how to use GitHub will need to push the changes to the remote side of this repository.

If you do know git, it gets a little bit more complicated to use this repository if Mala allows you to handle the version control. A git tutorial is shown in the tutorials folder of this repository.
